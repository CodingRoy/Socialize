/*!IMPORTANT! This is an example file on how to setup your database connection, your database type can be different. Your database name, user and password should be different!
* The PASSWORD_HASH can contain letters, digits and special characters so make it however you like, but once you start using it don't change it!
* Users who register won't be able to login anymore if the PASSWORD_HASH changes!!
* IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO MOVE THIS FILE AT LEAST DIRECTORY UP!! for security reasons. */
