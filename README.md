# Socialize

In this project I'm going to try to make a social website of any kind, users should be able to register,
log in and make posts on the 'dashboard'. Later on I want to try to give users the option to reply on posts,
and to mark posts as favourite in case something useful is in there ;).

This project is going to be made in an MVC structure based on PHP and a bit jQuery to give errors on the client-side.
