# Socialize

In this project I'm going to try to make a social website of any kind, users should be able to register,
log in and make posts on the 'dashboard'. Later on I want to try to give users the option to reply on posts,
and to mark posts as favourite in case something useful is in there ;).

This project is going to be made in an MVC structure based on PHP and a bit jQuery to give errors on the client-side.

## Recaptcha security
Google Recaptcha can be found here: https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/, sign in with your google account and make your API key here: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin#list.
### To get the Recaptcha working follow these steps:
* Create your API key's by registering your domain and copy your "Site key"
* Replace "Your Site key" in the config file: Socialize/config.php
* Copy your "Secret Key" from recaptcha and replace "Your Secret key" also in the config file. ;) 

Recaptcha should now work fine ðŸ˜„
